// Rules for LLMs when writing Laravel code:

1. Always follow PSR-12 coding standards and Laravel's own conventions for file and folder structure.
2. Use Eloquent ORM for database interactions unless raw queries are explicitly required.
3. Validate all user input using Laravel's built-in validation mechanisms (e.g., `$request->validate()` or Form Requests).
4. Never expose sensitive information (such as passwords, API keys, or environment variables) in code or error messages.
5. Use route model binding where possible for cleaner and safer controller methods.
6. Prefer dependency injection over facades in controllers and services.
7. Use migrations for all database schema changes.
8. Write clear, descriptive comments and PHPDoc blocks for classes, methods, and properties.
9. Use resource controllers and route resources for RESTful APIs.
10. Always sanitize and escape output in Blade templates to prevent XSS attacks.
11. Use Laravel's built-in authentication and authorization features for user access control.
12. Avoid using `dd()` or `dump()` in production code.
13. Use configuration files and environment variables for settings, not hardcoded values.
14. Write unit and feature tests for new functionality using Laravel's testing tools.
15. Follow naming conventions: controllers in `StudlyCase`, models in `StudlyCase`, variables and methods in `camelCase`, database tables in `snake_case`.
16. Use queues and jobs for long-running or asynchronous tasks.
17. Handle exceptions gracefully and use Laravel's exception handling features.
18. Use service providers for binding classes into the service container.
19. Keep controllers thin; move business logic to service classes or models.
20. Document any artisan commands or custom scripts created.
21. Use Artisan command to generate models, controllers, migrations, etc.

These rules ensure maintainable, secure, and idiomatic Laravel code.
